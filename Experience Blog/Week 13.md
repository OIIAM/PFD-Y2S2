## Week 13

In Week 13, I was tasked to attempt to fix Jeremy's previously broken user authentication page using Firebase, doing the Trello for Assignment 2 as well as assisting Aaron in doing some CSS work.

Jeremy Code:
I was asked by Vishwas if I could try and troubleshoot Jeremy's broken code very late into the week on Friday. This caused me to scramble in an attempt to fix Jeremy's broken code, by attempting to understand what Jeremy was trying to do in his code, as well as watching several videos on doing authentication using Firebase on C# as well as reading through the documentation on Firebase website. Unfortunately, watching and reading these guides caused me to be more confused as to what Jeremy was trying to do. Ultimately, I decided to start coding the user authentication from scratch. I first started to watch video tutorials on the topic however I was not able to find the proper C# tutorial as most of the YouTube videos are about user authentication on HTML which was something that we are not coding on. Thus, not very helpful. The documentation on the Firebase website was also mostly on HTML, not being very helpful as well.

Trello:
I started working on the Trello with information that I had during the meeting. which was that we will be completing the User Authentication, Sustainability for Guides, which includes the creation, deletion and editing of said guides, some improvements for the Forum's UI as well as the creation of an Events tab for users.
The Events Tab was to allow staff members to create events that are happening in the Community Centres in Singapore to notify the users of the website about them, encouraging them to participate in them.
