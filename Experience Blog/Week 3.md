## Week 3

Our team had a rather uneventful start to the project adventure at the beginning of Week 3. Our busy schedules and the fact that each team member was completely preoccupied with work for other course modules was the primary cause of the absence of meaningful preparation or tangible actions. But as we set out on a path to improved project management and teamwork, this week proved to be a turning point for us.

Our instructor gave us an introduction to Scrum during the lesson and gave us the assignment of creating a Scrum board on Trello. This was a crucial point because it signalled the start of a more planned and methodical approach to our project. We used the occasion to talk about how our project was coming along and to share the many things that each of us had worked on on our own. This demonstrated our successes and pointed out the areas where our project still needed improvement.

After learning the lesson, our team decided to assign each member distinct tasks to establish a more systematic approach. Our objective was to prepare a prototype for our lecturer's review in the upcoming session. I was given the task of writing an instruction guide for our prototype during this period.

This work first looked simple, but it soon became clear that it had its own set of special difficulties. The guidelines for our project's banking and telecommunications parts posed particular difficulties. I had to deal with potentially sensitive personal data as a result of these instructions, which made the process more difficult. I had trouble finishing this section of the guide because personal data is a sensitive topic when it comes to security and privacy. I was therefore only able to create an instruction manual that addressed the registration procedure up to a particular point. Any further development would require taking screenshots of possibly confidential data, which would present serious ethical and privacy issues.

This experience made it clear how crucial it is for our initiative to respect privacy and data security, as well as how important it is to handle these difficulties professionally. It also brought attention to how our project work was changing and illustrated the need for our team to become more flexible and adept at handling problems. Even though Week 3 seemed to go smoothly at first, it ended up being a turning point in our team's development as we realized the challenges and moral dilemmas that come with working on this project.
