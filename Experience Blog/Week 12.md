## Week 12

Week 12 was the start of the second term for the current semester. This week was not a great week as I was sick, especially so on Monday, which coincided with PFD, which was one of the modules that I have to pay more attention to. Which caused me to be unable to do much work that day.

I went to school on Tuesday while still feeling under the weather as that was one of the only few times that i will be able to meet the other team members just in case they needed to tell me something, which happened. Aaron briefed me on what they dicussed on Monday, and showed me some of the wireframes of what our website should look like.

I decided to do the Trello for the Assignment 1 portion as i realised that no one have done it yet
