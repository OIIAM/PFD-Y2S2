## Week 16

This week was the week everyone had been waiting for, the PFD presentation and also the official end of the PFD module.

Before the presentation, I was trying my hardest to memorize the script that I had written for the presentation as one of the feedback given to me by the lecturer during the Hackathon was that I was practically reading off the script without looking at the audience while presenting.

The team decided to meet before the actual presentation to practice the flow and ensure that we are keeping within the timing of 20 minutes. This includes doing the demo as well. There were some small challenges in regards to the overall presentation as we struggled slightly to keep within the time frame as we lingered a little too long on certain slides as well as faltering slightly on the demonstration portion as well since parts of it required the person demoing to constantly log in and out of different accounts to show what is happening on both the Staff and User side of the feature (This features include the guides, and events). Ultimately, we were able to summarize the talking points for the relevant slides further, as well as streamlining some of the processes to reduce the number of times the person demoing have to log in and out of the accounts, thus, keepign to our 20 minute time limit.

During the presentation, while I still did refer to my script, I believe that I was able to maintain more eye contact with the audience as compared to the first presentation during the Hackathon, which I was quite happy about as it meant that I had improved in some of my presentation skills.

Some of the feedback given by our lecturer, who is our first marker, was that our product was significantly better than what it was during the first Hackathon, which made the group happy as we put in a lot of effort into improving from our first solution.

I would like to thank Ms Lee, our lecturer for providing us with valuable feedback throughout the entire PFD module. Without her, I believe that our team would not have done as well as we would have liked for Assignment 2. I would also like to thank my team members: Aaron, Vishwa, Claire and Jeremy for the efforts that they have put into this solution to make it the way it is today! I hope to be able to work with you guys again in the future!
