Week 1
We returned to school on Monday, the first day of a fresh semester, with eager anticipation. In our first lesson, we participated in interesting exercises, one of which required us to assess how well we might function in a team given our skills and weaknesses. The lecturer would subsequently compile our responses, and the team leaders would review them in preparation for the upcoming assignment.
I am optimistic about working with the other members of my team, which consists of Aaron as the Team Leader, Claire, Vishwa, Jeremy, and myself. I've previously collaborated with Claire on several times and worked with Jeremy on an assignment. As we begin this new project, I feel at ease because I am familiar with their working methods.
Additionally, it was on this day that we had the honor of meeting Open Government Products, our challenge sponsor, and receiving our challenge statement, "Closing the digital divide for common services." We were entrusted with responding to the following challenge statement: "How might we enable those who may be affected by the digital divide, such as migrant workers and the elderly, to understand common services in areas like banking, healthcare, and government?"
Initially, our team's idea for a digital application to assist visually impaired and disadvantaged individuals received popular support through a vote on Padlet. However, after a thorough group discussion, we collectively decided to pivot our approach. We concluded that creating an effective application was a more complex undertaking than we had initially anticipated. Hence, we opted for a more manageable project - designing a website to assist the elderly in navigating commonly used applications, such as HealthHub, SingPass, and CPF.
Our decision to change course was rooted in our collective belief that we could deliver a more impactful solution within our skill set. Only Jeremy had prior experience with Mobile Application Development, and we were not confident in creating an application that could meet our high standards. As a result, we chose to adapt and work on a project better aligned with our abilities and resources.
