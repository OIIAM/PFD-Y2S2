<h1> Week 1 </h1>
Monday was the fist day back to school in a new semester for all of us. During the lesson, we did some activities which included writing what we believe are our strengths and weaknesses that could help in a team setting.
This will then be collected by the lecturer and will be chosen by the team leaders later on in the lesson to sort us into teams to proceed into the assignment.
My Team includes 4 others; Aaron (Team Leader), Claire, Vishwa as well as Jeremy. I am hopeful for this team as I ahve worked with Claire on numerous occasion as well as Jeremy on one assignment, thus, allowing me to work more comfortably with them as I have some knowledge on how they operate.
This was also the day that we met our Challenge Sponsor, Open Government Products and the challenge statement that was provided to us is <b>Closing the digital divide for common services</b>
The probelm statement is <b>How might we enable those who may be affected by the digital divide, such as migrant workers and the elderly, to understand common services such as those in banking, healthcare and government?</b>
Since the team leader was chosen based on popular vote of their idea in padlet, ours was originally going to be a digital application to assist the blind/disadvantaged individuals with disabilities. However, after discussing with the group, we have decided to change to making a website that helps the elderly in finding their way through most of the common applications that might be used by them ie. HealthHub, SingPass, CPF.
