## Week 6 Reflection

### Software Design and Architecture

#### What are System diagrams?

System diagrams are dynamic models that provide a visual depiction of the complicated interplay between process components. These diagrams go beyond standard process flow charts by including feedback loops as well as contextual aspects including attitudes, perceptions, and behaviours. One example of how system diagrams can help with decision-making is the optimization of supply chain logistics, where understanding feedback loops is critical for enhancing efficiency and avoiding delays.

#### What is Software Architecture?

The blueprint of a system is its software architecture, which defines its organizational structure and elucidates its behavioural patterns. It serves as the foundation for software development by acting as the backbone. The decisions made during the architectural phase, including trade-offs, have a direct impact on the system's quality, performance, and maintainability. Exploring how the use of a microservices architecture adds to scalability and resilience in a cloud-based application is one example.

#### What is Software Design?

Within the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), software design signals the transition from recognizing problems to developing solutions. This phase entails converting software needs into physical implementations. The design process, which emphasizes a solution-centric approach, generates a comprehensive strategy that considers user requests as problems to be fulfilled with the best solutions. Consider a hypothetical scenario in which diligent software design resulted in an intuitive user interface that effortlessly aligned with end-user expectations.

Major artefacts of the software design process include:

-- Software requirements specification: Expected system behaviour, including both functional and non-functional criteria, is described in this artefact. For a project to be successful, these needs must be traceable to business objectives, measurable, and clearly stated.

-- High-level Design: In this design phase, interactions are highlighted by dissecting the architectural design into sub-systems and modules. The high-level architecture of an e-commerce platform, which emphasizes module interactions for seamless user experiences, could serve as a practical example.

-- Detailed Design: This phase defines logical structures and interfaces with an emphasis on module-level implementations. Imagine a situation where a web application's database interactions are optimized by careful design, leading to improved overall efficiency.

#### What is the relationship between software architecture and design?

Software architecture hides the complexities of implementation while displaying the structure of the system. Its main focus is on the interactions between system components. Conversely, software design explores the finer points of implementation, covering issues such as component details, data structures, and algorithms. Given their natural overlap, combining architectural and design issues makes more sense. Examine an instance where cooperative decision-making between designers and architects produced a software system that was both elaborately planned and effectively executed.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, this emphasizes the complex dance between system diagrams, software architecture, and software design, to sum up. Developers may traverse the complicated terrain of software development more holistically and productively by accepting their dependency.
